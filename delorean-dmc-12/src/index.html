					Today in Great Britain and other countries of the former British Empire on November 5 people take to the streets with firecrackers and fireworks, rejoicing and burning a stuffed animal of "traitor Guy Fawkes". 
					<br>According to tradition, on this day, the English monarch comes to parliament, where a search is carried out before that - is there a treacherous Guy Fawkes lurking in one of the rooms with a supply of gunpowder?
					<br>Who is Guy Fawkes and why is the Guy Fawkes Night celebration held? Let's talk about some history facts.

						On the night of Novem&shy;ber 4th 1605, Guy Fawkes was caught guard&shy;ing thirty-six bar&shy;rels of gun&shy;powder in a cel&shy;lar be&shy;neath the Houses of Par&shy;lia&shy;ment in Lon&shy;don.
						<br>The con&shy;spir&shy;at&shy;ors of the Gun&shy;powder Plot were Ro&shy;man Cath&shy;ol&shy;ics who op&shy;posed the lack of re&shy;li&shy;gious tol&shy;er&shy;ance un&shy;der King James I. They planned to as&shy;sas&shy;sin&shy;ate James and his gov&shy;ern&shy;ment by blow&shy;ing up the House of Lords dur&shy;ing the State Open&shy;ing of Par&shy;lia&shy;ment on Novem&shy;ber 5th 1605. This was to be the start of a series of ac&shy;tions across Eng&shy;land that would lead to the in&shy;stall&shy;a&shy;tion of new Cath&shy;ol&shy;ic head of state.

						Fawkes and sev&shy;en oth&shy;ers were tried and con&shy;victed of treas&shy;on and ex&shy;ecuted in Janu&shy;ary 1606. His head was among those dis&shy;played on pikes at Lon&shy;don Bridge.
						<br>With&shy;in months Par&shy;lia&shy;ment es&shy;tab&shy;lished Novem&shy;ber 5th as a na&shy;tion&shy;al day of thanks&shy;giv&shy;ing and it was made il&shy;leg&shy;al not to join in the cel&shy;eb&shy;ra&shy;tions. The act re&shy;mained in force un&shy;til 1859.

						Sev&shy;er&shy;al tra&shy;di&shy;tion&shy;al rhymes have ac&shy;com&shy;pan&shy;ied the Guy Fawkes Night fest&shy;iv&shy;it&shy;ies. Rhymes tell us about his&shy;tory and the Guy Fawkes crime. The most pop&shy;u&shy;lar be&shy;gins with this words:

					<blockquote>
						<p class="quotation">
							&quot;Remember, remember the Fifth of November,
							<br>The Gunpowder Treason and Plot.
							<br>
							<br>I know of no reason
							<br>Why the Gunpowder Treason
							<br>Should ever be forgot.&quot;

						A tra&shy;di&shy;tion was that chil&shy;dren would make a dummy of Guy Fawkes and ask people for money (Aâ€˜Penny for the Guy') which they spend on fire&shy;works.
						<br>As the tra&shy;di&shy;tion of mak&shy;ing a dummy grew in pop&shy;ular&shy;ity, 'Guy' be&shy;came a word to mean any oddly dressed per&shy;son, then in the 20th cen&shy;tury it be&shy;came the com&shy;monly used slang word of today as a way of re&shy;fer&shy;ring to any male per&shy;son.
						<br>Fire&shy;works dis&shy;plays and Novem&shy;ber 5th bon&shy;fire parties are still com&shy;mon across Eng&shy;land.
